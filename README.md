# Oxymoron

Oxymoron is a pack meant for those who think normal kitchen sink packs are just a bit too easy, but who don't want to dive into traditional hardcore packs like Sevtech or Gregtech.

 

This pack offers many new and classic mods that you'd expect in a Kitchen Sink type of pack,  with the addition of some carefully selected hardcore mechanics to keep things from becoming too easy, or too overbearing. This is accomplished primarily by focusing on the survival aspect of Hardcore, as opposed to making progression extremely grindy.

 

The Primary goal behind Oxymoron, is to give players the ability to play the game how THEY want to, you are not limited by seemingly random gatekeeping, I.E. there is no requirement to do one mod before another becomes accessible. Want to play with Thaumcraft? Go right ahead! No locking it behind late game Botania or Blood Magic. Have a preferance for Thermal Expansion? Don't even worry about Immersive engineering then! You as the player have the freedom to play however you want.

 

This project is still in relatively early development, feedback would be greatly appreciated. I have quite a few plans for this pack but it will take a while to get there.
